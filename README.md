🤖 Elysium: Minecraft Anarchy Client
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Elysium, an advanced and external Minecraft Anarchy Client. Designed to give you a competitive edge, Elysium provides powerful automation modules like Crystal Aura and Auto Totem, all running seamlessly alongside your game. Its modular design makes it easy to add and remove new features, all controlled through a sleek, standalone application.

🛡️ Why Elysium is Undetected
Elysium is built from the ground up to be an external client. Unlike traditional clients that inject into the game process, Elysium operates completely outside of Minecraft. This unique approach means it does not modify the game's memory or code, making it significantly harder for anti-cheat systems to detect.

Zero Injection: Elysium never touches the Minecraft process.

Safe & Secure: Your Minecraft account remains secure as you're not using a hacked client.

Minimal Footprint: The client is designed to run in the background with minimal impact on game performance.

✨ Key Features
Crystal Aura: Automatically places and explodes End Crystals for maximum damage in PvP combat. 💥

Auto Totem: Instantly swaps a totem of undying into your offhand to prevent death, ensuring you always stay in the fight. 🛡️

Cross-Platform UI: The user interface is built with Eel, providing a sleek web-based experience on your desktop. 💻

Hot-key Integration: Trigger modules and actions with custom global hotkeys for seamless background operation. ⌨️

Effortless Distribution: Packaged into a single, standalone executable for easy sharing and deployment. No Python installation required for the end user! 🚀

Real-time Logging: A comprehensive log system helps you monitor module activity and debug issues. 📝

🚀 Getting Started (For Clients & End-Users)
This is the simplest way to get up and running.

Download: Grab the latest Elysium.exe from the dist folder.

Run: Simply double-click the executable to launch the application.

🛠️ For Developers
Interested in contributing or building your own modules? Here’s how to set up the development environment.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/elysium.git](https://github.com/your-username/elysium.git)
cd elysium

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Then, use the build_exe.py script to automatically handle all the dependencies.

python build_exe.py

(This script will install all necessary libraries and build the executable.)

3. Run the Application

To run the application directly from the source code, you can use the app.py file.

python app.py
