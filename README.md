# 🤖 Elysium: Minecraft Anarchy Client

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Elysium**, an advanced and external Minecraft Anarchy Client.  
Designed to give you a competitive edge, Elysium provides powerful automation modules like **Crystal Aura** and **Auto Totem**, all running seamlessly alongside your game.  
Its modular design makes it easy to add and remove new features, all controlled through a sleek, standalone application.

## 🛡️ Why Elysium is Undetected
Elysium is built from the ground up to be an **external client**.  
Unlike traditional clients that inject into the game process, Elysium operates completely outside of Minecraft.  

This unique approach means it does not modify the game's memory or code, making it significantly harder for anti-cheat systems to detect.

- **Zero Injection**: Elysium never touches the Minecraft process.  
- **Safe & Secure**: Your Minecraft account remains secure as you're not using a hacked client.  
- **Minimal Footprint**: Designed to run in the background with minimal impact on game performance.
