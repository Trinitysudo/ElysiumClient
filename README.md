# 🤖 Elysium

Elysium is an advanced external Minecraft client built for powerful automation modules such as **Crystal Aura** and **Auto Totem** — all running seamlessly alongside your game.  
It’s undetected on **DonutSMP**, **V+**, **JackpotMC**, and **CrystalChaos**.

---

## 🛡️ Why It’s Undetected
Unlike traditional injected clients, Elysium runs **externally** — it never touches Minecraft’s process or memory.  
This makes it significantly harder for anti-cheats to detect.

- **Zero Injection** – Never interacts with the game process  
- **Secure** – Your account stays safe  
- **Lightweight** – Minimal impact on performance
